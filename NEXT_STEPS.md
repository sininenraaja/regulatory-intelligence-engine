## This Week's Critical Actions

### ⏱️ Day 1: Market Validation (3-4 hours)

**Goal:** Confirm that 5+ potential customers care about this problem

**Tasks:**
```
1. Make a list of 10 potential customers
   - Target: Compliance teams at chemical/pharma companies
   - Size: 100-5000 employees
   - Geography: EU focus (REACH regulations)

   Sources:
   - Your personal network (Kemira peers)
   - LinkedIn (search "compliance manager" + "pharma")
   - Industry directories
   - Your own company contacts outside Kemira

2. Reach out with simple message
   "Hi [Name], I'm working on a tool to help compliance teams
    save time monitoring regulations. Do you have 15 minutes
    this week for a quick chat?"

3. Have 5 conversations
   Ask:
   - "How do you currently monitor regulations?"
   - "How much time does it take?"
   - "What are your biggest pain points?"
   - "Would you pay $500/month to save 10+ hours/week?"
   - "What would make this tool valuable to you?"

4. Take notes
   - Common themes
   - Objections
   - Enthusiasm level (1-10)
   - "Would you pay" answer
```

**Success:** 3+ people say they'd pay for this

---

### 👥 Day 2: Find Co-Founder (1-2 hours + ongoing)

**Goal:** Identify potential technical co-founder

**Ideal Profile:**
- Full-stack engineer (can build frontend + backend)
- 5+ years experience with Node.js/React/TypeScript
- Can commit 18+ months full-time
- Understands regulatory/compliance domain (nice to have)
- Has shipped products before
- Aligned on vision and timeline

**Where to Find:**
```
1. Your network
   - Current/former colleagues at Kemira
   - University friends
   - Previous team members
   - Recommend by multiple people

2. Specific communities
   - Tech Twitter/LinkedIn
   - Startup communities (AngelList, Facebook groups)
   - GitHub (stars, activity level)
   - Hacker News discussions

3. What to say:
   "I'm starting a regulated compliance software company.
    Looking for a technical co-founder who can build the MVP
    in 8-12 weeks. Expect to raise $500k seed and take this
    to $1M+ ARR within 24 months. Interested in learning more?"
```

**Success:** 2-3 conversations with serious candidates

---

### 📊 Day 3: Investor Strategy (2-3 hours)

**Goal:** Understand how to raise $500k seed round

**Tasks:**
```
1. Identify 5-10 target investors
   - Focus: Early-stage (seed/pre-seed stage)
   - Look for: SaaS focus, B2B software, domain expertise

   Sources:
   - Crunchbase (filter: seed stage, SaaS, Europe)
   - PitchBook
   - LinkedIn (search "early stage investor")
   - Local accelerators/VCs in your region

2. Research: What they fund
   - Typical check size ($100k-500k)
   - Their portfolio companies
   - Their focus areas

3. Find warm intros
   - See if you know anyone who knows them
   - Ask network for intros
   - Mutual connections = 10x better response rate

4. Prepare pitch deck outline
   - Problem (1 slide)
   - Solution (1 slide)
   - Market opportunity (1 slide)
   - Traction (1 slide) - can be customer interest
   - Business model (1 slide)
   - Financial projections (1 slide)
   - Team (1 slide)
   - Use (1 slide) - where money goes
   - Appendix: Use ROADMAP.md and DEVELOPMENT_STRATEGY.md

5. Schedule intro calls for next week
```

**Success:** 3-5 intro calls scheduled for following week

---

### 🔧 Day 4-5: Create Minimal Viable Product (MVP) Spec (4-6 hours)

**Goal:** Define what you'll build in Phase 1 (next 4 weeks)

**Tasks:**
```
1. Open ROADMAP.md Phase 1 section

2. Strip down to absolute minimum
   Current Phase 1 includes:
   - RSS monitoring from Finlex
   - AI analysis with Gemini
   - Error handling & monitoring
   - Database seeding

3. Cut anything that's "nice to have"
   - Error handling can be minimal
   - Monitoring can be basic
   - Can use free Gemini tier (2 req/minute, 50/day)

4. Define success criteria
   - "System runs for 2 weeks without manual intervention"
   - "New regulations appear in database within 30 min of publication"
   - "AI correctly scores relevance of 5+ test regulations"
   - "Can assign action items to departments manually"

5. Create 4-week sprint plan
   Week 1: Finlex RSS parser + database integration
   Week 2: Gemini API integration + caching
   Week 3: Error handling + monitoring
   Week 4: Testing + refinement + customer demo

6. Share with potential technical co-founder
   "Here's what I propose we build in the first month.
    What would you add/remove? Is this achievable in 4 weeks?"
```

**Success:** Clear MVP spec that can be built in 4 weeks by 1 engineer

---

### 💼 Day 5 (Afternoon): Pitch to Kemira (1-2 hours)

**Goal:** Get commitment to be your first customer/pilot

**Tasks:**
```
1. Schedule meeting with compliance team lead at Kemira
   Subject: "New tool to automate regulation monitoring - quick demo"

2. Prepare simple pitch
   "I'm building a tool that automatically monitors Finlex
    for chemical regulations and analyzes impact on our business.

    Current process:
    - Manual monitoring: 15+ hours/week
    - Creates action items: 4-8 hours/week
    - Spreadsheet tracking: 2-3 hours/week

    With tool:
    - Automatic monitoring: 0 hours/week
    - Auto-generated action items: 0 hours/week
    - Dashboard tracking: 1 hour/week

    Result: 18+ hours/week saved per compliance person

    Ask: "Would Kemira be interested in piloting this?
    We'd provide free access during development."

3. Show them current app
   - Go to https://dashing-starlight-0bbf50.netlify.app/
   - Show 3 sample regulations
   - Show how they'd click through for details

4. Get feedback
   - "What's missing?"
   - "What would make this valuable to you?"
   - "Who should I talk to in your department?"

5. Secure commitment
   - Ask: "Can we pilot Phase 1-2 with your team?"
   - Get: 2-3 users who'll test and give feedback
   - Agree: Bi-weekly feedback sessions
```

**Success:** Kemira commits to pilot + assigns 2-3 users for testing

## Next Phase: Building (Week 2 Onward)

Once you've completed this week's actions:

### If You Decide to Proceed
1. **Week 2:** Hire technical co-founder or start solo
2. **Week 3:** Begin Phase 1 development
3. **Week 4:** Soft launch with beta users
4. **Week 5+:** Rapid iteration based on feedback

### If You're Uncertain
1. Talk to 10+ more potential customers
2. Adjust product based on feedback
3. Consider building solo first (4-8 weeks)
4. Validate with small customer base before raising

### If You Decide Not to Proceed
That's also valid! You've learned:
- The market opportunity exists
- Customer demand is (or isn't) there
- You know what would be required
- You can reference this work in future ventures

## One Final Thing

**This week is NOT about perfection.** It's about:
- Getting 5-10 customer conversations done
- Finding out if your co-founder hypothesis is right
- Understanding if investors will fund this
- Making a clear go/no-go decision

If you go 0/3 on these fronts, that's valuable information too. Doesn't mean don't build—just means refine the positioning, timing, or approach first.

**You already built a working MVP.** That's 90% of the work a lot of people never do. Now validate that real customers care about it.

Get to work. 🚀
