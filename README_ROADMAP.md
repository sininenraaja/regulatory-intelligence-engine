## The Vision in One Sentence

**Transform regulatory compliance from a 20-30 hour/week manual process into a 2-3 hour/week automated system, saving companies $50k-100k/year while preventing $50k-500k violations.**

---

## The Opportunity

### Market Size
- **TAM:** $6.5 billion compliance software market (15% CAGR)
- **Our addressable:** $325 million (5% of market)
- **Realistic Year 3 capture:** $32.5 million (0.5% of TAM)

### Customer Segments (Priority Order)
1. **Chemical Manufacturing** - 2,000 companies, $200k-1M/year budgets
2. **Pharmaceuticals** - 5,000 companies, $500k-2M/year budgets
3. **Food & Beverage** - 10,000 companies, $100k-500k/year budgets
4. **Environmental Services** - 5,000 companies, $150k-600k/year budgets

### Why This Matters
- **Current state:** Teams manually scan 50+ regulations to find 3 that matter
- **Time wasted:** 20-30 hours/week for compliance teams
- **Cost:** $50k-500k fines when regulations are missed
- **Solution:** 10x faster, 100x cheaper than consulting, prevents violations

## Red Flags to Watch For

🚩 **No customer enthusiasm** after Week 1 validation
→ Pivot positioning or feature focus

🚩 **Can't find technical co-founder** after 2 weeks
→ Consider hiring instead of co-founder
→ Or build MVP solo first (feasible in 8-12 weeks)

🚩 **Investors say no repeatedly**
→ Doesn't mean don't build
→ Might need proof of customers first
→ Apply to accelerators or bootstrap instead

🚩 **Phase 1 takes >6 weeks**
→ Scope too large
→ Cut features aggressively
→ Ship with fewer features

🚩 **Customer doesn't use product**
→ Wrong feature focus
→ Pivot to Phase 2 features
→ Get more feedback

## The Real Question

This roadmap exists to answer one question:

**"Can I build a $10M+ business in the regulatory compliance space?"**

The answer is: **Yes, the market opportunity is real. The question is can YOU execute.**

2. ✅ Technical execution (find co-founder)
3. ✅ Capital (raise $500k)
4. ✅ Persistence (24 months discipline)
5. ✅ Smart execution (follow this plan)

You now have a complete roadmap. You've built a working MVP. You have everything you need.

**The only question left is: Will you build it?**

## Final Thoughts

You're in a unique position:

✅ You understand the problem (compliance is painful)
✅ You have domain expertise (chemical industry)
✅ You have a working MVP (already built)
✅ You have a first customer (Kemira, potentially)
✅ You have a complete roadmap (this document)

That puts you ahead of 99% of startup founders.

Now go validate the market and start building.

The next 24 months will determine if this becomes a $10M+ business or a valuable learning experience.

Either way, you win.

**Go do this. 🚀**
